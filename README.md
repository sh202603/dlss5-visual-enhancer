## Main features

### DLSS 5 Neural Rendering

- **Neuroframe Engine:** brings DLSS 5 Neural Rendering to images and videos directly inside Visual Enhancer. No external graphics injector or game add-on is required.
- **Image and video processing:** enhance single files or full batches with previews, per-file progress, and diagnostic reports.
- **Neural Rendering controls:** NR Style, NR Intensity, Local Tone Strength, Local Structure Strength, Skin Structure Strength, Automatic Mask, and 1–4 Neural Rendering passes.
- **Composition controls:** NR Color Strength, Tone Preservation, Face/Skin Protection, Grain Preservation, and Mask Feather give additional control over how Neural Rendering is blended with the source.
- **Detail-Only:** one-click preset that keeps the source color and tone while retaining Neural Rendering detail changes.
- **Custom NR Mask:** use an image mask to control where Neural Rendering is applied. The selected mask is also available to Live during the current application session.
- **Shimmer Suppression:** helps stabilize fine detail between frames in Video and Live processing.
- **Processing scale:** process at Source, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 75%, 50%, or 25% of the source dimensions. This is separate from RTX Video Super Resolution.
- **HDR preservation:** supported video workflows can preserve 10-bit HDR with H.265, AV1, or ProRes Proxy output.

### RTX Video Upscale

- **NVIDIA RTX Video Super Resolution:** enhance and upscale images or SDR video with VSR quality levels 1–4.
- **Flexible sizing:** use 1× native-resolution enhancement, 1.5×, 2×, 3×, 4×, or custom output dimensions up to 16384 pixels per dimension.
- **NVIDIA RTX Video HDR:** convert SDR video to HDR with adjustable contrast, saturation, middle gray, peak luminance, and processing precision.
- **Combined processing:** RTX Video Super Resolution and RTX Video HDR can be used together, or RTX Video HDR can be used by itself.
- **Image output:** PNG, JPEG, WebP, AVIF, and TIFF with quality, metadata, and naming controls.
- **Video output:** H.264, H.265, AV1, and ProRes Proxy, with NVIDIA NVENC options where available.

### DLSS Frame Generation

- **Frame Interpolation:** uses NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation to create additional frames for smoother video playback and high-frame-rate output.
- **Target frame rates:** choose from 23.976 up to 480 FPS, including common cinema, broadcast, and high-refresh rates.
- **DLSSG modes:** **Auto**, **Native DLSSG**, and **Cascade** provide flexible interpolation for different source and target frame rates.
- **Preview clips:** render 3, 5, 10, 20, or 30 seconds from the current playhead before starting a full render.
- **HDR preservation:** 10-bit HDR output is supported with H.265, AV1, and ProRes Proxy.

### Live

- **Local and online playback:** apply DLSS 5 Neural Rendering while watching local videos, direct network streams, YouTube, and Twitch sources.
- **Integrated playback:** pause or resume playback, control volume and mute, expand the player, or enter fullscreen without leaving the Live workflow.
- **Live quality controls:** choose source quality, maximum input resolution from 480p to 2160p, 1/2/4-second segments, Auto/Source/60/30/24 FPS modes, and a 2–30 second playback buffer.
- **Independent Live tuning:** Live keeps its own Neural Rendering settings, so Live adjustments do not overwrite the main Neural Rendering settings. The custom NR mask remains shared for the current session.
- **Dynamic updates:** most Neural Rendering controls can be changed while Live is running. Source, scale, quality, frame-rate, segment, and buffer changes apply the next time Live starts.
- **Performance information:** view processing and playback status while Live is running.

### Workflow and preview

- **Unified media viewer:** compare Input and Output with **Split**, **2-Up**, and **Output** views, fit images to the viewer, inspect them at 100%, and scrub through video from a shared timeline.
- **Realtime preview:** supported Neural Rendering and Upscale changes can refresh the current preview automatically. Video previews can follow the selected playhead position.
- **Batch processing:** add multiple files or folders, drag and drop media, retry failed items, clear completed items, stop processing, and reveal completed files in Explorer.
- **Clipboard images:** paste supported image content directly into image workflows.
- **Per-file progress:** each queue item shows its current state, progress, elapsed time, processing details, dimensions, and output path.
- **GPU selection:** choose the GPU used for AI processing separately from the GPU used for NVIDIA NVENC video encoding.
- **Automatic containers:** H.264 uses MP4, H.265 and AV1 use MKV, and ProRes Proxy uses MOV.
- **Safe output handling:** completed files are kept, incomplete work is cleaned up when needed, and existing files are not silently overwritten.
- **Media preservation:** supported workflows preserve useful source information such as rotation, timestamps, metadata, chapters, audio, and subtitles where possible.

Completed media is saved to `outputs/`. Logs and diagnostic reports are available in `logs/` for troubleshooting.

## Supported media

| Type | Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Images | Common image formats, HEIF/HEIC, SVG, TIFF, and many camera RAW formats | PNG, JPEG, WebP, AVIF, TIFF |
| Video | MP4, MKV, MOV, AVI, WebM, M4V, TS/MTS/M2TS, MXF, VOB, WMV, FLV, MPG/MPEG and other supported video formats | H.264, H.265, AV1, ProRes Proxy |
| Live | Local video, direct network streams, YouTube, Twitch | Processed playback inside Visual Enhancer |

Image processing applies EXIF orientation, handles supported color profiles, preserves supported metadata where possible, and keeps transparency except when saving to JPEG. Animated and multipage image sources use the first frame/page.

## Requirements

- **Windows:** 64-bit Windows 11 with Direct3D 12.
- **NVIDIA RTX GPU:** a compatible NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU with a current NVIDIA driver.
- **DLSS 5 Neural Rendering:** availability depends on supported NVIDIA RTX hardware, the installed driver, and successful feature initialization on the selected AI Processing GPU.
- **DLSS Frame Generation:** requires compatible NVIDIA RTX hardware. Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling (HAGS) should be enabled.
- **RTX Video:** RTX Video Super Resolution and RTX Video HDR require compatible NVIDIA RTX hardware and driver support.
- **NVIDIA NVENC:** NVIDIA NVENC output requires hardware encoding support for the selected codec and output settings. CPU encoding options are also available.

## Settings

### DLSS 5 Neural Rendering

| Setting | Values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NR Style | Default, Natural, Cinematic | Default |
| Scale | Source (Original), 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 75%, 50%, 25% | Source (Original) |
| NR Intensity | 0.00–2.00 | 1.00 |
| NR Passes | 1–4 | 1 |
| Local Tone Strength | 0.00–2.00 | 1.00 |
| Local Structure Strength | 0.00–2.00 | 1.00 |
| Skin Structure Strength | -1.00–2.00 | -1.00 |
| NR Color Strength | 0.00–1.00 | 1.00 |
| Tone Preservation | 0.00–1.00 | 0.00 |
| Face/Skin Protection | 0.00–1.00 | 0.00 |
| Grain Preservation | 0.00–1.00 | 0.00 |
| Mask Feather | 0–128 output pixels | 0 |
| Automatic Mask | Off, On | Off |
| Shimmer Suppression | 0.00–1.00; Video and Live only | 0.70 |

**NR Passes** controls how many Neural Rendering passes are applied. Additional passes increase processing and can produce a stronger cumulative result.

**Scale** controls the size used for Neural Rendering. Source keeps the original dimensions; percentage options process at the selected size. Neural Rendering dimensions must stay within the supported 64×64 minimum and 7680×4320 maximum boundary. This setting is separate from RTX Video Super Resolution.

**Detail-Only** sets NR Color Strength to `0.00` and Tone Preservation to `1.00`. All other Neural Rendering controls remain editable.

Setting Skin Structure Strength above `-1.00` automatically enables Automatic Mask so the skin adjustment can take effect. Automatic Mask can still be switched off manually afterward.

### Upscale: Image

| Setting | Choices and behavior | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VSR quality | 1 - Low, 2 - Medium, 3 - High, 4 - Ultra | 4 - Ultra |
| Output sizing | Scale factor or Custom dimensions | Scale factor |
| Scale factor | 1×, 1.5×, 2×, 3×, 4× | 2× |
| Custom dimensions | Up to 16384 pixels per dimension; cannot be smaller than the source | 3840×2160 |
| Lock aspect ratio | Off, On | On |
| Output format | PNG, JPEG, WebP, AVIF, TIFF | PNG |
| Image quality | 1–100 for lossy formats | 95 |
| Preserve EXIF Metadata | Off, On | On |
| Rename | Auto, Copy, Custom | Auto |

RTX Video Super Resolution can be used at **1×** to enhance an image without enlarging it. A selected image can be previewed before the final render.

### Upscale: Video

| Setting | Choices and behavior | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RTX Video Super Resolution | Off, On | On |
| VSR quality | 1 - Low, 2 - Medium, 3 - High, 4 - Ultra | 4 - Ultra |
| Output sizing | Scale factor or Custom dimensions | Scale factor |
| Scale factor | 1×, 1.5×, 2×, 3×, 4× | 2× |
| Custom dimensions | Up to 16384 pixels per dimension; cannot be smaller than the source while VSR is enabled | 3840×2160 |
| Lock aspect ratio | Off, On | On |
| RTX Video HDR | Off, On; converts SDR input to HDR | Off |
| HDR contrast | 0–200 | 100 |
| HDR saturation | 0–200 | 100 |
| HDR middle gray | 10–100 | 50 |
| HDR peak luminance | 400–2000 nits | 1000 nits |
| HDR processing precision | Packed 10-bit, Packed 10-bit (FP16) | Packed 10-bit |
| Video codec | H.264, H.265, AV1, ProRes Proxy; CPU/NVIDIA NVENC variants where available | H.265 (NVIDIA NVENC) |
| Container | Selected automatically from the codec | MKV |
| Encoding quality | Auto (Default), Good, Best, Max | Auto (Default) |
| Rename | Auto, Copy, Custom | Auto |

RTX Video Super Resolution and RTX Video HDR can be used together. VSR can also be disabled for HDR-only processing, but at least one RTX Video effect must be enabled.

RTX Video HDR accepts SDR source video and creates HDR output. Existing HDR input is not accepted by this workflow. HDR output requires H.265, AV1, or ProRes Proxy.

### Frame Interpolation

| Setting | Choices and behavior | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output FPS | 23.976, 25, 29.97, 30, 50, 59.94, 60, 90, 119.88, 120, 144, 165, 180, 240, 360, 480 | 60 |
| DLSS engine | Auto, Native DLSSG, Cascade | Auto |
| Preview length | 3, 5, 10, 20, 30 seconds | 3 seconds |
| Video codec | H.264, H.265, AV1, ProRes Proxy; CPU/NVIDIA NVENC variants where available | H.264 (NVIDIA NVENC) |
| Container | Selected automatically from the codec | MP4 |
| Encoding quality | Auto (Default), Good, Best, Max | Auto (Default) |
| Preserve 10-bit HDR | Off, On; H.265/AV1/ProRes only | Off |
| Rename | Auto, Copy, Custom | Auto |

**Auto** selects the appropriate DLSS Frame Generation path for the requested source and output frame rates. If the selected output FPS is equal to or below the source frame rate, frames are resampled without generating additional frames.

### Live

| Setting | Choices and behavior | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source | Online URL or Local video | Online |
| Source quality | Auto, 480p, 720p, 1080p, 1440p, 2160p | Auto |
| Max input resolution | 480p, 720p, 1080p, 1440p, 2160p | 720p |
| Segment duration | 1, 2, 4 seconds | 2 seconds |
| Target FPS | Auto, Source, 60, 30, 24 | Auto |
| Playback buffer | 2–30 seconds | 6 seconds |
| Neural Rendering controls | Independent Live copy of the Neural Rendering controls | Neural Rendering defaults |

Most Live Neural Rendering controls can be changed while playback is active. Buffered frames keep their previous appearance until playback reaches newly processed frames. Scale, source, source quality, maximum input resolution, segment duration, target FPS, and playback buffer take effect on the next **Start Live**.

### Video output and encoding

| Output setting | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| H.264 | MP4; CPU or NVIDIA NVENC; 8-bit SDR |
| H.265 | MKV; CPU or NVIDIA NVENC; supports 10-bit HDR mode |
| AV1 | MKV; CPU or NVIDIA NVENC; supports 10-bit HDR mode |
| ProRes Proxy | MOV; CPU-based 10-bit 4:2:2 output; supports HDR mode |
| Encoding quality | Auto (Default), Good, Best, Max |
| Rename | Auto creates a workflow-specific name; Copy keeps the source base name; Custom adds the selected suffix |

Compatible workflows preserve metadata and chapters where supported. MKV can keep compatible audio and subtitle streams, while MP4/MOV use AAC audio. Supported text subtitles can be retained where the selected workflow allows it.

### Application

| Setting | Choices and behavior | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI Processing GPU | Automatic (Best Available) or a compatible detected NVIDIA RTX GPU | Automatic |
| Video Processing GPU | Automatic or a detected NVIDIA GPU used for NVIDIA NVENC/NVDEC work | Automatic |
| Preview Encoding Strategy | Auto, Always H.264, Disabled | Auto |
| Realtime Preview | Off, On; Neural Rendering and Upscale | On |
| Full-size quality preview | Off, On; keeps full-resolution image previews where supported | On |
| Settings preset | Export or import adjustable application settings as JSON | n/a |

Saved GPU selections follow the selected GPU identity. If that GPU is no longer available, the setting returns to Automatic. Compatible older settings presets can be imported and migrated automatically.

## Command line

The same processing layer is available as a `dlss5ve-cli` command for scripts and other programs. The portable package runs it with the embedded interpreter; a development checkout can also install it with uv.

```powershell
.\dlss5ve-cli.bat info                                           # GPUs, encoders, frame generation, RTX Video
.\dlss5ve-cli.bat image photo.png --nr-passes 2 --format PNG
.\dlss5ve-cli.bat image photo.png --color-strength 0 --tone-preservation 1  # Detail-Only composition
.\dlss5ve-cli.bat video clip.mp4 --codec "H.265 (NVIDIA NVENC)" --hdr --output-dir D:\out
.\dlss5ve-cli.bat interpolate D:\clips --fps 60                  # a folder processes its supported files in name order
.\dlss5ve-cli.bat upscale-video clip.mp4 --scale 2 --hdr         # RTX Video Super Resolution plus RTX Video HDR
.\dlss5ve-cli.bat upscale-image photo.jpg --width 3840 --format PNG
```

```powershell
uv sync                           # core: video and frame interpolation
uv sync --extra image             # adds RAW, HEIF, and SVG decoding for images
uv sync --extra webui             # adds gradio (implies image)
uv run dlss5ve-cli info
```

- Defaults come from `config/config.ini`, the same file the WebUI writes. `--preset FILE` applies a preset exported from the Settings tab instead; flags override individual values on top.
- `image` and `video` expose every Neural Rendering control of the WebUI: `--nr-style`, `--nr-intensity`, `--nr-passes`, the tone and structure strengths, the composition controls (`--color-strength`, `--tone-preservation`, `--face-skin-protection`, `--grain-preservation`), `--nr-mask FILE` with `--mask-feather`, `--nr-scale` (1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25: the resolution entering Neural Rendering; enlargement is `upscale-*`), and for video `--shimmer-suppression`. `image` also takes `--nr-gpu/--no-nr-gpu` (Processing Engine Path). Video chooses its path from the codec: NVENC codecs keep decode, render, and encode on the AI GPU and ignore `--video-gpu`; CPU codecs stage through system memory. The container follows the codec (H.264 MP4, H.265/AV1 MKV, ProRes MOV).
- `upscale-video` and `upscale-image` run RTX Video Super Resolution (and RTX Video HDR for video) with the Upscale tab's saved settings as defaults. `--scale FACTOR` or `--width PX` (with `--aspect-lock`, or `--height PX` with `--no-aspect-lock`) chooses the output size; `--no-vsr --hdr` converts SDR to HDR10 at the source size.
- Neural Rendering and RTX Video run through different NGX bridges, so combining them is two commands: `examples\nr_vsr_hdr.ps1 INPUT -OutputDir DIR -Scale 2` renders NR first (SDR, source size) and then applies VSR and RTX Video HDR to the result.
- `--json` writes the batch result to stdout: `status` (`success`, `partial`, `cancelled`), `output_directory`, `log_path` (the session log in `logs/`), the effective `options`, and the per-file `successes` and `failures` with their dimensions, frame counts, and bridge diagnostics. Progress and the per-file summary go to stderr; `--progress json` turns progress into JSON Lines with one object per file state change, `--quiet` silences both.
- `--version` (also the first line of `info` and `--help`) prints the package version and the upstream release it is built on; the package version follows the upstream release in its first two components.
- Exit codes: 0 all inputs succeeded, 1 some failed, 2 usage error or missing input, 3 runtime or GPU unavailable, 130 interrupted. Ctrl+C stops the batch cleanly (incomplete output removed, finished files kept); a second Ctrl+C aborts.
- `image`, `video`, and `upscale-image` write files only; add `--zip` for the ZIP the WebUI offers. `video` also takes `--preview-seconds SEC` or `--preview-frames N` for a short test render. One GPU render per process; two `dlss5ve-cli` processes at once will both initialise the Neural Rendering runtime.
- To use the package from another project, add this checkout as an editable dependency (`uv add --editable <path to this folder>`). If the package ends up outside the checkout, point `DLSS5VE_HOME` at the checkout so the runtime binaries are found.
